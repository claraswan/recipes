    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>After I perfected my muffin recipe, I decided that the best complement to that would be some homemade butter. It's simple, fun, and probably burns a few calories.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup fresh heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
        <li>some cheese cloth</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour cream into a large mason jar, ensuring the cream doesn't take up more than a third of the jar.</li>
        <li>Add the salt to the jar and seal it.</li>
        <li>Vigorously shake the jar for roughly 5-10 minutes until the fat separates.</li>
        <li>Pour jar contents into some cheese cloth to drain the buttermilk from the lump of butter.</li>
        <li>Rinse the lump of butter with cold water and put it in a jar or butter dish. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
